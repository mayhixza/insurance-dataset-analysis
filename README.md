# Medical Cost Insurance Dataset Analysis

This repository contains code and documentation for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project conducted on Kaggle's [Medical Cost Insurance dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance). The project aims to explore the relationships between various factors and medical insurance costs, utilizing data visualization techniques and implementing linear regression models. The dataset is also available [here](https://github.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets).

## Project Overview:
Dataset: Kaggle's Medical Cost Insurance dataset
Objective: Explore factors influencing medical insurance costs and build predictive models.
Techniques Used: Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Linear Regression
Tools Used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, SciPy

## Variables in dataset
age: age of patient in years  
sex: binary value, either 'male' or 'female'  
bmi: body mass index of patient  
children: number of children of a patient  
smoker: binary value, 'yes' or 'no'  
region: region where patient resides  
charges: insurance charges for a patient  

## Key Findings:
1. Identification of significant factors affecting medical insurance costs.
2. Visualization of relationships between variables using various plots.
3. Development of predictive models to estimate insurance costs.
